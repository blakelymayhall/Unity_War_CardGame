## "Story" / Pre-Match Modifiers
- Sticking with the game theme "War" -- Maybe the player selects a state in a tumultuous time; 
but hilariously all physical violence is settled via this card game.
- Goal of the game is USA domination?
- Fighting on home-land increases rank +1
- State deck sizes aren't necessarily even 
- State may have baked in modifier -- PA, Hearts rank +1 for instance  

## In-Match Modifiers
- What makes the game fun to play while you are playing it?

## From Phone Notes:
War Game Ideas
- state-specific cards mixed in deck
- Player can edit deck after conquering or stalemate with other states to include other state cards
- States begin aligned 
- Might lose cards in retreat 

Remember, war is battle simulations. Hands are battles. Draws are battles where you need reinforcement.

Basic intelligence: know number of cards opponent has +/- N% 

Enhanced intelligence cost cards and can give stats of opponent 

Still need something to do that’s not just flipping cards….

reinforcement deck - three+ cards that are set aside to be used at will to sum with your card(s)

Cards lose rank when they lose a hand. 

Card less than or equal to 4 are killed? No… something needs to reduce cards post battle tho. 

Marketplace to buy power ups with card rank 

Get additional cards proportional to state pop after

Rest days increase ranks?

Choose number of cards to send to battle 
- brings up good question:
- Are the states a monolith or individuals? I.e. does each state have own deck? Probably not, not fun to maintain and “deck build”
- So states are a monolith. But then every battle is the full might of the monolith vs single states? Smaller monoliths? I guess, yes. Since you start as one or two states.
